# Sudoku Webapp

This project was inspired by solving [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/) on LeetCode by using a really simple backtracking algorithm. 
<br>
A really fun project in general, and the challenges I faced are

- Organizing my code (which I still think is bad btw)
- Figuring how would the hinting system work (this current hinting system was not my initial idea, but it turnt out better)
- Figuring out a scoring system (which I did not succeed, I've taken a look at chess rating system, but I couldn't handle the math :P), someday....
- Making it responsive to any sizes of screen (which I did not succeed, there's still a minor bug on this)

# Things Undone

- Responsiveness

# Reference

- [Program for Sudoku Generator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-sudoku-generator/) (The idea of randomizing the upper left 3x3, middle 3x3, and bottom right 3x3 was taken from here, which also implied that my sudoku puzzle is not completely random, there's only (9!)^3 permutation.)
- [Cartoon Push Button](https://codemyui.com/3d-cartoon-push-button-effect-in-css/) (I modified a litle bit from it)
